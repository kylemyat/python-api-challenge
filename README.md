## WeatherPy
In WatherPy, I used the Citypy Python Library and OpenWeatherMap API with plots and linear regression to present corelations between city location and different weather factors such as humidity, wind speed, cloudiness and max temperature.

## VacationPy
In VacationPy, I used imported data of different cities and their coordinates/weather data. I then used the Geoapify API to find hotels based on the previous coordinates.

From this I was able to find potential hotels for a vacation that match my weather preferences and time of year.

### Tools Used
Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, Requests, Scipy.stats
